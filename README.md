## üöÄ Development Server

To start the development servers for both the backend and frontend, you can use the `devserver.py` script. This script will launch both the Django backend and the Vite frontend development servers.

### Usage

1. Ensure you have the necessary virtual environment and dependencies installed for both the backend and frontend.

   Inside the `oykus/backend` directory, run the following command to install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   Inside the `oykus/frontend` directory, run the following command to install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Run the following command to start the development servers:

   Inside the root directory, run the following command to start the development servers:
   ```bash
   python devserver.py
   ```

3. The backend server will start on port `8000`, and the frontend server will start on port `5173`.

4. To use Django management commands, you can use the following command, example to run the migrations:

   ```bash
   python devserver.py migrate
   ```

### Stopping the Servers

To stop the servers, you can use `Ctrl+C` in the terminal where the script is running. This will gracefully terminate both the backend and frontend processes.
